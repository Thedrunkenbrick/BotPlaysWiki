# Background Pokemon

The background pokemon was a feature added by 40Cakes to add some interactivity to the stream, the full code of which can be found at https://github.com/40Cakes/stream-background

## How it works

Every 5 minutes, the background will refresh and pick 16 new pokemon from the list of sprites, an index of which can be found [Here](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/ani/). There is also a 1/128 odds that the selected Pokemon will be a shiny. On top of that there is a  1/64 chance that a swarm will appear which will cause one Pokemon and 15 variants of it to appear for a total of 16 pokemon. The same shiny chance will still be applied to each Pokemon of the swarm.

### Fakemon

Cakes also decided to add a allow for a rare chance of fakemon to be spawned instead of a regular mon each refersh, a list of which can be found at https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/cap/

### April Fools

During april fools, Cakes will replace the background pokemon list with the april fools sprites from the showdown list.

## Ineteractions

There are a few main ways that the viewer can interact with the background pokemon:

- [Bingo](/Bingo):
	This involves users attempting to fill out a predetermined board of pokemon.
- Background Tracker:
	This is a complete list of the background pokemon that viewers can attempt to fill out.
