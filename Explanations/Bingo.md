# Bingo
[Bingo](http://tinyurl.com/pokemonbingov3) is a game made by WhiskyPapa involving the [Background Pokemon](/Background-Pokemon) from the 40Cakes Stream. It involves looking for specific Pokemon in the background of the stream and marking them off in your sheet. It was first released by Whisky on the 16th of September 2023. There are two main ways to play Bingo, [Personal Bingo](#personal-bingo) and [Weekly Bingo](#weekly-bingo). 


## Personal Bingo

Personal Bingo involves creating your own bingo to attempt to fill out with no Time limits. This can be done either manually or using the seed generator randomly pick them. There are a few main options to choose from when using the Seed to generate a board:

- Specific Generations
- Allowing Fakemon
- Differentiate between similar looking genders 
- Disallow multiple forms
- Difficulty Slider 

Due to the way the Background Pokemon generate the rarest non-shiny pokemon to appear are specific form pokemon (E.G. an unown J). This is why the difficulty slider changes how many multi-form pokemon appear. Most people tend to have a personal shiny bingo that they will complete over a long period of time and focus mostly on competing in the weekly bingo.

## Weekly Bingo

Weekly Bingo (also commonly referred to as Ranked Bingo) involves a common board that everyone is racing to complete as quickly as possible. The first weekly bingo was released on 26th of September 2023. Initially the Pokemon on the board where chosen by Whisky however it was later decided that the winner of the previous weekly bingo would get to choose the theme and design the board. This soon became the main way to play bingo. 

At first the main incentive for winning was bragging rights as well as competing over who could win Bingo the most times, however on the 16th of April 2025 Whisky released ranked bingo, which involved a few main changes to how this was played:

- Each weekly would have a 1st, 2nd and 3rd places who would all get points based on there placing
- There were now "seasons" of ranked, with each season lasting 12 weeklys
- At the end of each season the winner would be decided by the most ammount of points
- If at the end of the season there was a draw, a sudden death match will be played to decide a winner
